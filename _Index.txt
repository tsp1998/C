note**:
1. Switch  statement program also called menu driven program
2. call by value means parameters should passed (declared) in function bracket
3.call by address/reference means pointers(parameters with star symbol prefix i.e. void ts(int *s)) should passed (declared) in function bracket
4.ASCII-american standard code information interchange
5.switch accepts integer,char parameter not float whereas if accepts all types of parameters
6.fn1()//caller function
{
	fn2();//called function
}
7.function declaration known as function prototyping
8.%p used for address format specifier(i.e. show the address value)
int x; int *y=&x;
e.g. printf("%p",&x) or printf("%p",y)
